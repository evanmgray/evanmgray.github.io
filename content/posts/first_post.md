Thanks for visiting and poking around to read :)

## Why a Website?

Aside from the obvious career-related benefits of having a home on the internet.

1. I specifically did not want to use prebuilt websites, and instead learn how to use static builder (like Hugo). 

2. I've started to take a more proactive approach to taking notes when I read, listen, or am at work. My goal is to, over time, put these into blog posts here to force me to synthesize and think deeply about information I consume.

## My Path To Get Here

1. Think about using Squarespace or something similar, decide I want hard mode to learn.
2. Find Hugo by googling "basic website builder"
3. Go through a ton of pain to setup S3, Route 53, Cloudfront, and SSL for my DJ group's [website](https://lightroastdisco.com)
4. Realize GitHub Pages is MUCH easier, and set this website up with it.
5. Start with the PaperMod theme, then swich to this LoveIt theme.
