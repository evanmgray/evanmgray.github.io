Cover Image - Word cloud of all Gartner “Magic” Quadrant Categories, Jan 2024 Management - the act or art of managing : the conducting or supervising of something (such as a business) However, in the enterprise software context, I’d argue we should use this definition. Management - the activities and responsibilities involved in conducting a business process or project Its utility and fraught nature come from its nebulous use. By tacking on the word to the end of any business concept, you’ve created an entire category of software to potentially sell: Customer Relationship Management Enterprise Service Management Content Management Sales Performance Management Is this a bad thing though? Business complexity necessitates complex software. Branding software as “management” creates a shared understanding of a problem between the seller and the buyer, and lumping the complexity of a particular domain into the idea of “management” helps move sales discussions forward. But yes, it is bad. This nebulousness represents what’s broken at the core of the software itself, as well as the processes to buy and implement it. By avoiding the use of the term altogether, maybe, we (those of us building, selling, and buying B2B software) can collectively create better outcomes for businesses and the humans within them.

This person is a typical white-collar worker trapped in the unglamorous world of execution - actually doing the work. They must fabricate a simple reality for leaders while dealing with rote challenges and mistakes of junior team members. Their impetus for a software purchase comes either from frustration, comparison to other companies, or improving the bottom line while also covering the all-important digital transformation initiatives pushed by their leaders. With aspirations of true organization change, the manager eagerly considers their options, begins researching their competitors, reads analyst reports, taps their network, and engages with sales reps1. They create a group of stakeholders to help with the decision, conduct long RFP processes, and usually decide on an established vendor.2 Over the course of this process, before any software is rolled out and hearts and minds are won, the battle has usually already been lost.

They do this by: Identifying problems in the customer’s organization Quantifying the monetary impact of those problems Demonstrating how features of their product solve those problems. This is a strong argument. It demonstrates an honest interest of the vendor in the buyer’s company, an eagerness to partner on solving problems, and overall empathy. The problem is that this is a fabricated reality that oversimplifies the problem and paints the wrong targets that will likely persist through the deployment of the software. The complex process full of human-to-human interactions has now been distilled down to a handful of specific problems that a rigid “management” software solution can ostensibly solve. Bear with me for a moment, as I take you through an example loosely inspired by my own experience. Julius is responsible for payroll. As part of this role, he has to make sure recently hired employees are created in the payroll system. It takes Julius two hours every week to run a report from the separate HR system and load those employees manually into the payroll system. This manual process leads to errors and sometimes employees getting missed., especially when Julius is away. Alex, Julius’s team lead, is considering new payroll software and is won over by a vendor with strong integration3 offerings, especially with HR systems. Three months and hundreds of implementation hours later, the new payroll system is setup with data flowing from the HR system. However, following one of the first payrolls on the new system, Alex is dismayed to hear a recent new hire was missed. As it turns turns out, the “integration” brings only brings in an employee’s annual salary, not the biweekly amount. That still needs to be entered by Julius. When Alex tries to understand why this was not automated, they learn the first payroll amount is pro-rated by the number of days the employee was hired, but different divisions have different policies. Julius says he expects an email from the manager saying how much it should be and enter that. In this case, the manager never sent the information before the deadline. A computer can only do so much when the process is still dependent on another human’s input. By oversimplifying the problem during the buying cycle, and falling for a fabricated reality of what “payroll management” involves, Alex has solved one part of the problem but fallen short of the desired outcome. Enterprise/B2B software implementations have dozens of these use cases where better is still not good enough. Functionality, designed and built at great expense, ends up as useful as a bridge that spans 90% of the way across a river but stops short of reaching the other side.4 Regardless of how strong vendor arguments for software’s capability for “managing” a process, the only way problems can truly be solved is by understanding the problems at their core. Once you do that, you’ll find “management” is too vague a word, and the exact solution you need will be obvious, and may not be new software.

This is about more than just a word (that we should stop using). To make software purchasing, implementation, and usage better, both for software vendors and customers, there’s some core principles everyone should accept. Customers with complex business processes must accept that they’re going to end waterfall software implementation with a minimum viable product and a long to-do list of things learned from the project. Software implementation projects help hit a date, but getting the promised value from software requires a commitment to continuous, iterative improvement from those managing it. Software vendors must focus on solving a core problem well, and not building to over-fit, tech debt-ridden customer solutions. Customers must demand a solution from their vendors where the core 10x technology is obvious and idiot-proof, working even if the software is implemented and used by recent graduates with no experience in the process or industry. Customers must ask vendors not just can a system support a process, but how. They must look past the simplified workflows in demos, and demand that they see examples of how the system reacts to change in the process, people, and data involved. Customers must see true empathy from the vendor, and any other implementation consultants involved, for their employees.

They’re trained to find and empathize with the precise challenges this manager faces in their job. They share stories about how other leaders have transformed their business, and chart a path for growth and success in your role because of their software. Sales reps for smaller companies will present themselves as a Silicon Valley-esque success story that’s innovating the industry. If the company likes their monolithic ERP provider then they probably go with that company’s point-solution-turned-suite-through-acquisition. Alteratively, the manager picks what they used in a prior job if they liked it. If they didn’t like it, they choose whatever is left. Integrations is a fraught word and the bane of many a software company. Except in software, that last 10% is spanned by resources employed to make it seem like the bridge is actually there.

Introduction Next year, me, my partner, and two cats will leave our long-time home of Chicago. I’ll be leaving my fully remote job as a project manager at an enterprise software startup, where I am appreciated and well-compensated, in order to enroll in a full-time MBA program. My whole seven-year career has been in software. By opting to sacrifice two years of earning for a piece of paper with no intrinsic value, direct exposure to technology, or guarantee of employment in my current field (all while in a tech industry downtown) I’m taking on, to put it lightly, some risk.1 However, I believe the risks are justified by the opportunities two years in business school will provide 2: Chances to do great work on a variety of problems with a variety of amazing people Guidance and practice reps to develop my “personal brand” and networking skills, enabling me to find and make connections with people who enjoy working on similar problems An accelerated introduction to a new area of the country with proximity to family, amazing nature, and great long-term career prospects Life-enriching experiences bleh as I’m surrounded, in-person, by people who come from unique backgrounds but are experiencing similar emotions during a transition periods in their lives If you’re still reading, congrats on your gag reflex being strong enough to handle MBA cliches and idealism. Opting to go to business school is the most deliberate action I’ve taken to steer my career. Up to this point, my career decisions have all been made partially out of convenience. But with each decision though, the balance as tilted away from convenience and towards greater risk and opportunity. With this decision, more than ever before, I’m actively taking on personal and financial risk in a hope that I’ll emerge with a more fulfilling career path and, in turn, more meaniningful life. I hope this may help someone making a similar decision in their life, and have included some links at the bottom of resources that I found useful.

I’ve given many answers, but there’s one I found myself settling on: “I’m not learning enough - most of the feedback I get from my peers amounts to ‘keep up the good work’. I’m in a small “pond” which makes me feel like I’m not realizing my full potential. Attending an MBA program in (insert coastal tech hub) will put me in a big “pond” where I’ll be surrounded by talented, ambitious classmates and tech industry leaders I can learn from and work with.” Finding a larger “pond” is conventional wisdom, but not an unalloyed good. The tradeoffs of “big fish in a small pond” vs. “small fish in a big pond” have been discussed at length by Malcolm Gladwell and in academic contexts. Here’s the gist: Being at the top of the group hierarchy, even if it’s a small unremarkable group, boosts one’s “academic self-concept.” On the other hand, being at the bottom of a group, even if it’s a remarkable group (like I will likely to find at a “top” MBA program) can harm it. This “academic self-concept\" is correlated with motivation and academic performance. Put directly, there’s a chance that I might find myself overwhelmed by the caliber of my classmates and lose motivation to grow my career. Personally, my approaches to both the application process, and career progression in general, mitigate this risk. I was very selective in my MBA applications. I didn’t apply very widely or chase MBA prestige. By the numbers, regardless of where I go, I’ll be an above average student and my background in software and consulting is likely to help me fit into the culture well. I’ve already made many jumps to bigger “ponds”. I’ve a very risk averse person and, like many, have dealt with imposter syndrome throughout my career. In changing jobs, I’ve favored incremental jumps to slightly larger “ponds” rather than reaching for the most prestige. With each jump I’ve had to manage anxieties that I’ll be inferior, and keep an intense focus on being humble and learn from those around me. But with each jump I’ve found a way to succeed. Going to business school represents a larger but still incremental jump that I believe I can handle, if not thrive by. The bigger “pond” also comes with a major upside. The greatest moments of enjoyment and growth in my career have come from working with talented, opinionated managers, teammates, and clients focused on understanding and solving interesting problems. These people were open to being vulnerable, asserting their ideas, and learning from those around them (regardless of place in a hierarchy). My big bet (for the investment into an MBA) is that I’ll find more of these moments through an MBA program, and find a cause/organization that can continue to deliver those beyond graduation.

Footnotes and Further Reading Avoiding lifestyle creep while working in consulting helps reduce this risk. This is applicable to so-called “top” programs that, due to their prestige and reputation, attract individuals from diverse backgrounds and have opportunities to connect you with individuals in a large variety of roles and industries. This blog post makes a strong case for why to get an MBA that I found reiterated in my one-on-one chats with current and former MBA students. I used Applicant Lab. It helped me realize how much of the application process required playing a game where only a few know the rules.
